ScalaFXML Example
=================

This example demonstrates use of FXML with ScalaFX using
[ScalaFXML](https://github.com/vigoo/scalafxml) library.

The source code is based on [FXML example from ProJavaFX](https://github.com/scalafx/ProScalaFX/tree/master/src/proscalafx/ch10).
The [ScalaFXML](https://github.com/vigoo/scalafxml) library enables much simplified way of using
FXML from ScalaFX.

At a moment, you need to build [ScalaFXML](https://github.com/vigoo/scalafxml) and publish
locally before using this example.
