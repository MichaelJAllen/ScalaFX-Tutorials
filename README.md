ScalaFX-Tutorials
=================

Examples of using ScalaFX. Each example is a stand-alone complete project

*  __hello-sbt__: 
   a basic example of using [Simple-Build-Tool](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) (SBT) and [ScalaFX](http://scalafx.org). Detailed description can be found in the blog post ["Getting Started with ScalaFX: Compile and Run"](http://codingonthestaircase.wordpress.com/2013/05/17/getting-started-with-scalafx-compile-and-run-2/). 

*  __stand-alone-dialog__:
   shows how to display a ScalaFX dialog (stage) without using JFXApp. You can use this approach, for instance, to show a JavaFX dialog from a command line or from a Swing application.

*  __event-filters__:
   demonstrates use of ScalaFX Event Filter API. The code is based on JavaFX example [Handling JavaFX Events, Part 3 Working with Event Filters](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/events/filters.htm).
